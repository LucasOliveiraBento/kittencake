        <h2>Ingredients and their Quantities</h2>

        <p>&#x2714 6 tablespoons full of unsalted margarine</p>
        <p>&#x2714 3/4 cup (chocolate tea)</p>
        <p>&#x2714  1/2 cup (tea) powdered chocolate</p>
        <p>&#x2714  1 and 1/4 cup (tea) wheat flour</p>
        <p>&#x2714 2 cups (tea) sugar</p>
        <p>&#x2714  4 eggs</p>
        <p>&#x2714  2 pinches of salt</p>
        <p>&#x2714   1 teaspoons of vanilla extract or essence</p>
        <p>&#x2714   1 tablet of dark chocolate, cut off into cubes</p>
        <p>&#x2714  1/2 cup (tea) of chopped walnuts or granulated cashew nuts</p>

        <p><h2>Method of Preparation</h2></p>

        <p>1️⃣ Mix eggs and sugar.</p>
        <p>2️⃣   Then add all the other ingredients to form a uniform cream.</p>
        <p>3️⃣  Pour into a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a medium oven for 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>4️⃣   The brownie will be ready when the top is lightly colored and, when you stick a toothpick, it is slightly damp (due to the melted chocolate).</p>
        <p>5️⃣ Cut into squares while still hot and serve with a scoop of ice cream, or freeze in a freezer bag.</p>
        <p>6️⃣ To thaw, place the brownie on a dessert plate and heat it in the microwave on high power for 1 minute.</p>
