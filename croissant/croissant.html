        <h2>Ingredients and their Quantities</h2>

        <p>&#x2714 3 cups of wheat flour (approximately)</p>
        <p>&#x2714 1 tablespoon full of instant biological yeast (10g)</p>
        <p>&#x2714 3 tablespoons of butter at room temperature</p>
        <p>&#x2714 2 level tablespoons of sugar</p>
        <p>&#x2714 2 eggs beaten lightly</p>
        <p>&#x2714 1 spoon of salt</p>
        <p>&#x2714 ½ cup of water at room temperature</p>

        <p><h2> To roll the dough:</h2></p>

        <p>&#x2714 100g of butter at room temperature</p>
        <p>&#x2714 1 tablespoon of wheat flour</p>
        <p>&#x2714 1 beaten egg to paint</p>

        <p><h2>Method of Preparation</h2></p>

        <p>1️⃣ In a bowl place ½ cup of all-purpose flour, mix the yeast and sugar, mix well, add salt, water, eggs, 3 tablespoons of butter and beat well with a spoon.</p>
        <p>2️⃣ Add flour little by little, transfer to the table and continue kneading, this time with your hand, always sprinkling wheat flour.</p>
        <p>3️⃣ Work on the table to smooth, make a ball of dough and place in a bowl sprinkled with all-purpose flour, sprinkle with all-purpose flour, cover with a plastic bag and a dish towel and let it rest for 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>4️⃣ Mix 100g of butter with 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour and set aside.</p>
        <p>5️⃣ Roll out the dough with a rolling pin and spread pieces of butter with flour and fold the dough as a package, so the butter does not come out, open it again on a table sprinkled with flour, turning the dough on both sides, leave it half thick, about 1 cm , try to form a rectangle of dough when opening, cut 10 triangles (the bigger the better), roll it like a croissant, to make it easier, make a small cut in the widest part and pull the ends slightly to the sides, roll it until the thinnest end and place on the greased and floured baking sheet, with the fine point down.</p>
        <p>6️⃣ Heat the oven at medium/low temperature for 10 minutes while the dough rises, brush with beaten egg and bake in 15 minutes, until golden.</p>
